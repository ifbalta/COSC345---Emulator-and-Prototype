		<p>
			For the assignment 3, we redo the maze game simulator structure and rewrite the JavaScript.We use the physics 2D engine for the ball movement in the maze.We used several different images to be the maze game structure such as the ball, wall and the maze background.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Isabel Baltazar and Lennox Huang were assigned the code on the emulator and report, Raeciel Reyes and Kimi Zhou were learn the physics 2D engine structure to manipulates the ball can work smoothly in every level of the maze game.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			For our application, it is a maze game and we use up, down, left and right on keyboard to control the ball movement. There are different levels in this game, the user will go to the next level once the ball arrive the hole. <br>

			Evaluation

		</ul> -->
		<p>The previous emulator and maze game application failed to keep the maze game application and browser independent of each other. The original maze game application used jQuery to handle user input, even though the maze game isn’t allowed to know about the browser. The emulator was supposed to be an interface between the application and the browser, but the emulator isn’t allowed to know anything specific about the application either.<br>
		</p>

		<p>We’ve rebuilt the emulator to have functions that raises flags to indicate user input. The Maze Game Application has been rewritten to use the Phaser.io framework and the emulator’s input flags. The emulator no longer knows about the game, and the game no longer knows about the browser.

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		Requires git VCS be pre-installed.<br>
		git can be downloaded from <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads"> git-scm.com/downloads.</a>
		<p>
		For compatibility with non-Safari browsers, node.js and Express.js or python must be installed.<br><br>
		If using a python server:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python</a> from their website
			</li>
			<li>
				Navigate to the webRoot directory and run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code> on the command line.
			</li>
		</ul>
		If using a node server:
		<ul>
			<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">node.js</a> from their website</li>
			<li>Install Express.js by running <code>npm install express --save</code> on the command line</li>
			<li>Navigate to the webRoot directory, and start the server using the command <code>node bootup</code></li>
		</ul>
		The emulator is open-source and available on GitHub.
		Get the code <a href="https://github.com/ifbalta/COSC345---Emulator-and-Prototype.git">
			here</a>.
		<ol>
			<li>Clone the repository using
				<code>git clone https://github.com/ifbalta/COSC345---Emulator-and-Prototype.git</code> or
				Git clients such as SourceTree or the GitHub GUI
			</li>
			<li>Using Safari, open <code>emulator.html</code> in the broswer</li>
			<li>
			Using Google Chrome,
			<ul>
				<li>
					Using node, start server through <code>node bootup</code> and navigate to
					<code>http://localhost:3000</code> in the browser
				</li>
				<li>Using python, start server through <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code> and navigate
					to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<p>
		<h2>For Users</h2>
		<p>
		Starting up the emulator is as simple as opening <code>emulator.html</code> in Safari, and selecting an app
		from the menu.<br>
		<h3>Not using Safari?</h3>
		<p>
			The emulator is compatible with Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera if you have node.js and Express.js pre-installed.
		</p>
		<h2>For Developers</h2>
		<p>
		The emulator uses jQuery's getScript() function to retrieve AppObjects from other JavaScript files.<br>
		<h3>Installing your own application</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Applications must be written in JavaScript and follow the AppObject structure</li>
			<li>Store your application in the <code>appDir/</code> directory.
				<br> Your folder must have the same name as your main JavaScript file.
				If your file is named <code>example.js</code> it must be stored in the <code>example</code> directory.
				<br> The resulting file path should be <code>appDir/example/example.js</code>.
			</li>
			<li> Add your application to the app tray on <code>emulator.html</code>.
				The app tray is a select menu with an <code>label</code> property. The <code>value</code> attribute must have the
				same name as your main JavaScript file.
				<br>If your file is named <code>example.js</code>, then its <code>value</code> must also be <code>example.js</code>
			</li>
		</ol>
		The emulator expects an AppObject with three properties:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3><code>startUp</code></h3> should initialize the application.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><code>stopScript</code></h3> should stop the application.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><code>clear</code></h3> should clear the screen.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br><a href="index.html"></a>
		The emulator itself has only four functions:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3><code>bootup()</code></h3>
				<p>
				<code>@param</code> filename<br>
				the file from which the AppObject can be retrieved
				<p>
					<code>bootup()</code> is tasked with clearing and stopping any previously running applications before initializing a new AppObject.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><code>clear()</code></h3>
				<p>
					<code>clear()</code> clears the emulator screen.
					It does not stop the application. Stopping the application should be the
					<code>AppObject's stopScript</code> property's responsibility.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>
					A function linked to <code>emulator.html's start</code> button.
				</h3>
				<p>
					The function uses jQuery to select a file from the app tray.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><code>selectFile()</code></h3>
				<p>
				<code>@param</code> filename the selected application
				<p>
					Responsible for adding the file path to the file name.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Bugs</h2>
		<ul id="bug-list">
			<li>The emulator cannot completely stop an application from running</li>
			<li>The emulator does not always clear the screen</li>
