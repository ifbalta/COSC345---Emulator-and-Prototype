		<p>
			For the assignment 3, we redo the maze game simulator structure and rewrite the JavaScript.We use the physics 2D engine for the ball movement in the maze.We used several different images to be the maze game structure such as the ball, wall and the maze background.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Isabel Baltazar and Lennox Huang were assigned the code on the emulator and report, Raeciel Reyes and Kimi Zhou were learn the physics 2D engine structure to manipulates the ball can work smoothly in every level of the maze game.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			For our application, it is a maze game and we use up, down, left and right on keyboard to control the ball movement. There are different levels in this game, the user will go to the next level once the ball arrive the hole. <br>

		<p>The previous emulator and maze game application failed to keep the maze game application and browser independent of each other. The original maze game application used jQuery to handle user input, even though the maze game isn’t allowed to know about the browser. The emulator was supposed to be an interface between the application and the browser, but the emulator isn’t allowed to know anything specific about the application either.<br>
		</p>

		<p>We’ve rebuilt the emulator to have functions that raises flags to indicate user input. The Maze Game Application has been rewritten to use the Phaser.io framework and the emulator’s input flags. The emulator no longer knows about the game, and the game no longer knows about the browser.<br>
		</p>

		<h2>Emulator</h2>
		We use warper to warp the function and update the key objects. We set up each directional key as a flag.There are several functions in the emulator file:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><code>addResource()</code>: To allow us to add images to the emulator and allow it to paint them. </li>
			<li><code>setup()</code>: To initialize the emulator, we set up the key object for up, down, left and right to control the ball movement. The key press is stand for swiping.</li>
			<li><code>mapKey()</code>: To default undefined key as unpressed and do nothings.</li>
			<li><code>resetKeys()</code>: To reset all the keys back to original states.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Maze Game Application</h2>

		<p>
		We used Phaser.io’s game engine(phaser.min.js) for our maze game application. The game.js file is to create and load images and game details into the emulator.  We used several functions in game.js file:<br>
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>preload()</code>: Load the image and all maze levels to the emulator.</li>
			<li><code>create()</code>:  To create and set up the rules for the game, when the ball arrive the hole, the map will change it to the other map. </li>
			<li><code>setup()</code>: To initialize the map, tile layers and prevent the collision occurs.</li>
			<li><code>destoryEverything()</code>: To check whenever the game has to rest the map and tile layer.</li>
			<li><code>winLabel()</code>:To shows the winning text.</li>
			<li><code>update()</code>: To check overlapping for the ball and hole.</li>
			<li><code>checkOverLap()</code>: This function will called when the ball is overlapping the hole.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Group Evaluation</h2>
		<p>
			Our group have meeting for the assignment every once a week, we separate the workload into different part for every member to work. During the time slot, some of the member got sick because of the bad weather conditions. We decided to take two weeks break to recovery from the sickness. However, each member manage the time well and learning new knowledge for the assignment. In assignment 2, our maze game application can not work independently, so we decide to rebuilt the javascript file and the emulator. We shared different opinions during the meeting and some learning the new engine for our game’s movement to improve the assignment progress.
