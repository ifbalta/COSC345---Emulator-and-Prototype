			<b>Authors:</b><br>

		<p>
			<b>Language:</b> JavaScript<br>
			<b>Dependencies:</b>
			Phaser.io version 2.3.0 provided by <a href="https://phaser.io">Phaser.io</a><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The aim of the maze game application is to reach the hole at the centre of the maze.<br>
			The ball movement can be controlled by arrow keys. There are multiple levels of increasing difficulty.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Requirements:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="EmulatorDocumentation.html">Install</a>
			the emulator.<br></li>
			<li>The game uses Phaser.io's game engin, which requires a server to run. The emulator comes with a node server, or if you have python pre-installed, you can use python's SimpleHTTPServer. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			How to play:
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Simply use your "Up, Down, Left, Right" key on the keyboard to move the ball.</li>
			<li>The ball will not be able to pass the maze when they collide.</li>
			<li>The only way to continue to the next level is reach the hole at the centre of the maze.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>For Developers</h2>
		The JavaScript files, game.js and phaser.io's game engine(phaser.min.js) are used to load and create images and game details into the emulator.

		<h3>Tools we used:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Phaser.ioâ€™s game engine version 2.3.0 (phaser.min.js) - For our maze game application's ball movement and collision detection.</li>
			<li>Tile Map Editor - To create different mazes as maps on each level.</li>
			<li>Sublime Text 2 - A text editor for code and markup.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Game.js functions:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><code>preload()</code>: Loads images and all of the maze levels to the emulator.</li>
			<li><code>create()</code>: Starts and creates the game and identifies if it's going to the next level. </li>
			<li><code>setup()</code>: Initialises the game engine, map, tile layers and collision detection</li>
			<li><code>destoryEverything()</code>: Clears the game's map and tile layers for the next level of the game.</li>
			<li><code>winLabel()</code>:To show the winning text.</li>
			<li><code>update()</code>: Updates the ball movement when arrow keys are being pressed. It also calls the checkOverLap function to check if the ball reaches the hole.</li>
			<li><code>checkOverLap()</code>: This function will called when the ball is overlapping the hole.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Bugs
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sometimes, there is a random collision between the ball and an empty space(which is a tile that we are unable to see).<br>
				<b>Solution:</b> All you need to do is refresh the page and it will disappear.
			</li>
		</ul>
