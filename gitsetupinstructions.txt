Setting up Git on your computer:
        1. Download Git and/or GitHub GUI
        2. On the command line, type
           git config --global user.name "Your Name"
           git config -- global user.email "Your Email"

Setting up your copy

Getting a copy of  the git repo:

        1. Get a git account and download the GitHub GUI or Git bash
        2. Tell me your username or add your username to the list so
        that I can add you to the list of collaborators.
        3. Type 'git clone
        https://github.com/ifbalta/COSC345---Emulator-and-Prototype.git'
        into the command line or use the GitHub IDE.
        This command will create a folder called
        â€œCOSC345--Emulator-and-Prototypeâ€� in your local directory
        and create a local copy of the repository.
        4. All done.

Adding changes:
      Note: If this is a new file, you must track the file first using :
               'git add filename'  or 'git add --all'

      1. git commit -a
         This command adds all modified tracked files to the git repo.
         This command will ask for a comment of your changes using VIM.
         Just use :wq to save your comment.
      2. git push
         This command will push your changes to the repository

Ensuring that you have the updated version:
         1. git pull
         Pulls the most recent additions to the master branch
         git pull [remote] [branch]
         Pull the specified branch from the remote. eg: git pull origin version-1
         2. git merge A
         Merge the current branch with branch A

Creating a new branch:
         1. git checkout -b your_branch_name
         2. git push origin your_branch_name
         3. Tell everybody else about it.

Checking out a branch:
         1. Clone the master branch
         2. git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name
         3. Done!

 Git and Eclipse:
 	If you're having trouble with using git using the command line,
 	you can use Eclipse and EGit to manage commits for you.
 	
 Setting up EGit:
 	
 	1. Install Eclipse
 		The latest one is Luna.
 	2. Click Help->Install new software
 	3. In the "work with:" input field, enter "http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates"
 	4. Select all available, and click finish to complete installation.
 
 Setting up your repository:
 	At this point, you've probably already cloned the repository locally.
 	So all you have to do is tell Eclipse where to find it.
 	
 	1. Click Window->Show View->Other->Git->Git Repositories
 	2. On the lower left corner, there should be a bunch of icons that look like
 		folders labeled 'GIT'. Click on the one with a green cross, meaning
 		'Add an existing Local Repository to this View'
 	3. You'll get a pop up asking where to find your repository.
 		Click browse and find the folder where you've stored your repository.
 	4. All done.
 	
 Commit:
 	1. Right-click on your repository and then select commit.
 	2. All done.
